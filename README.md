What is TAIsync?
TAIsync is a Chrome extension that automates the process of syncing your extracted coding problem solutions and notes directly to a GitHub repository, helping you track and showcase your coding progress effortlessly.

How fast is it?
TAIsync is designed to work seamlessly, ensuring your solutions are pushed to your GitHub repository in just a few seconds, making your workflow smooth and efficient.

Why use TAIsync?
Build a Strong Developer Portfolio:
GitHub is the number one platform for developers to showcase their skills and contributions. TAIsync automatically syncs your coding challenges, solutions, and notes to GitHub without any manual steps, making it easier to maintain a polished portfolio.

Eliminate Manual Work:
Manually uploading your coding solutions to GitHub is tedious and time-consuming. TAIsync handles this for you automatically, so you can focus on solving problems and improving your skills instead of managing repositories.

How does TAIsync work?
Your coding portfolio will automatically update as you work. Here’s how to get started with TAIsync:

Install TAIsync:
Once installed, launch the extension.

Login via GitHub Token:
To authorize TAIsync with your GitHub account, you will need to use a GitHub personal access token. Here's how to generate one:

Go to your GitHub account settings.
Navigate to Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Generate new token.
Ensure the token has appropriate permissions (like repo access) for pushing code to your repositories.
Copy and save the token, as you will use it to log in via TAIsync.
Set Up Repository:
After logging in with your GitHub token, you will need to provide the repository path where your solutions will be stored.
Important: Enter the full GitHub repository path in the format username/repo-name (e.g., johnDoe/myCodingSolutions). 

Syncing Solutions:
Once setup is complete, simply click the "Sync" button, and TAIsync will extract your solution and notes, then automatically upload them to your GitHub repository. The extension will create a new folder in the repository for each coding problem and upload the code, along with a README containing the problem statement and other details.

Why was TAIsync built?
