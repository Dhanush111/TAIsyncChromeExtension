TAIsync Chrome Extension
TAIsync is a Chrome extension designed to streamline your coding process by automatically pushing your code to GitHub when you complete TAI problems. This guide will walk you through the setup and usage of TAIsync, including how to obtain a GitHub token and configure your repository.

To authorize TAIsync with your GitHub account, you will need to use a GitHub personal access token. Here's how to generate one:

Go to your GitHub account settings.
Navigate to settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic) > Generate new token.

Ensure the token has appropriate permissions (repo access) for pushing code to your repositories.
Copy and save the token, as you will use it to log in via TAIsync.
